<h3><font face=calibri color="black" size="4">Little Soni was playing with her friends one day after school. Strong wind was blowing. Suddenly they saw that something fell down from a tree on the grass. They ran towards the tree to see what it was. When they reached, they were surprised to see a nest with three eggs in it and when they looked up, they saw two little birds flying around the tree. They wanted to place the nest back on the tree to help the bird family. So Soni picked up the nest, kept it in her bag, and started climbed up the tree, she kept the nest in its place and jumped on the ground. Then the kids waited for the parent’s birds to fly into the nest but they did not, so they resumed playing. After sometime, the kids returned to the tree and saw that the eggs were smashed down on the grass and broken. They felt really sad and returned home. At home, Soni told everything to her mom to which her mom replied that birds do not keep anything that a human touches. Soni understood that she should never touch any egg, bird baby, or nest ever again.<br>
