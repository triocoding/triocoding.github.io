One day when the Pandavas where on Vanvas ,Sahadev the youngest brother went to fetch water.After some time he did'nt return so Nakul went in search of him.Almost an hour had passed but they both did not reurn.In the same way Arjun and Bheem also went to the lake but did not come back.So Yudhishtir the oldest brother went to the lake in search of his brother.There he met a rakshas.He said"I know where your brothers are but first you must answer my questions correctly in order to save your brothers.Yudhishtir answered all of the yaskshas' questions correctly.Then ,the rakshas tranformed into a demigod who said i am yakshak.This is a test sent by the gods to test your dharma.Iam happy to tell you that you have passed.Just then yudhistir found his brothers and they all bowed down to the gods and went on their ways.
