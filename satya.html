<h2><font face="elephant" color="black" size="5"><b>Satya</b> is a Sanskrit word that describes a virtue present in many different Indian religions. When translated to English, it means “truth."<br>
Satya is considered essential for a balanced and harmonious existence in the universe. .<br>
 In short, satya refers to truth and essence.<br>
Truth-telling makes possible freedom and trust between people, and, in the life of faith, it makes possible closeness to God.<br>
Here is a story on truthfulness :-

A wolf is eating all my sheep!".All the villagers rushed to save the sheep.But they found that the sheep were happily grazing in the field.This happened for a few days.Then ,one morning when he was looking after the sheep a big wolf entered the field and started chasing the sheep.The boy ,Terrified ran to the villagers to get help.Alas, none of the villagers helped his and thus, he lost all his sheep.<br>
