<h2><font face="elephant" color="black" size="5"><b> Shanthi </b> is a Sanskrit term meaning "peace." In both Hindu and Buddhist practices, shanti is often chanted three times to represent threefold peace in body, mind and spirit.
<h3><font face=calibri color="black" size="4">
One day a king announced an art competition to paint a picture depicting peace.Mant atists submitted works of calm skies ,mountains ,lakes and many other sceneries.But the winner was a picture who depicted a scene of stormy skies and rugged and bare lands.Everyone thought it was the opposite of peace.But the king explained that in the picture there is a small tree in which a mother pigeon sat peacefully on her eggs even when there was a storm going on.It means thatPeace does not mean being in a place with no noise or trouble. Peace means to be in the midst of all the chaos and still be calm in the heart. Real peace is the state of mind, not the state of the surroundings. The mother bird at her calm, despite her chaotic surrounding, indeed was the best representation of peace.
<p class="one">
Moral:Even if your surrounding are'nt calm, being peaceful inside is the everlasting peace.</p></font></h3>
